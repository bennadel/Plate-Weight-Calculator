This is just a fun little project to try out **Standalone components** in Angular 14. Note that there are no modules in this application - just the app component, which is bootstrapped using `bootstrapApplication( AppComponent )`, the `MeterComponent`, which is used internally, and the `UrlStateService`, which is used internally.
